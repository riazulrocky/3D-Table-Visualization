# 3D Table Visualization

This project demonstrates how to visualize a 3D table with a stable wall background in Python using Matplotlib and NumPy. It provides an example of creating cuboid components (table legs and top) and rendering them in 3D.

## Features
- Create a table with four legs and a top.
- Add a simple wall background for context.
- Customize colors and transparency.
- Adjustable viewpoint and aspect ratio.
